# This is a modest collection&hellip; of precisely one as of October 15th 2015.
This is a group of files at the moment that aim to provide shortcuts for the soon to be outdated Windows PC. I am ready to embrace *NIX whether that means Linux Ubuntu or MacOS given the opportunity. Meanwhile&hellip;

## What&rsquo;s this for and what is this all about you ask, right?
Utility. Speed. That&rsquo; five words! This is a private library in a not so private society. This is called being worth your salt barring the obligatory constraints.

### This forum is like TOASTMASTERS, man!
Butterflies notwithstanding I feel this is a lazy way for the PC user to follow some of the lessons that are commonly geared for a *NIX box. The guano files (named like that because they&rsquo;re not .bat nor are they extension .sh but a mix of the two) are as much a testament to the fact that I learn something everyday as they are built plainly for the sake of simplifying workflow. The prefixes are as such in order to remind me that they are insignificant and can be built again. And, now I would like to share. For a PC, this library will start with a folder called **path_to_git_pc** when in deed it&rsquo;d normally correspond (in NON-BASH terms) to: **`%ProgramFiles%\Git\cmd`**. An additional ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE was not acceptable today on my machine, thus, something practical in my opinion and machine agnostic should be sufficient for you. Now get on board! These will be far and frequent.

#### Abstract and Guide

| Original Intent | Then, my bandaid for a solution | True Path to PC file | How do I use it? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| For use with configuration settings as applied to GIT configuration. | I built a pair of .bat files based on some configurations I had seen on the internet; proper attributions will follow shortly.| %ProgramFiles%\Git\cmd | **`git config --global core.editor "guano-git-editor-npp.bat"`** ( for either WIN or *NIX ) |

##### Dedicated to
My little sister whom my parents brought into this world as a gesture of love for everyone. You are a joy! Stay strong! I love you, chicky. The Lord Yehovah has given you a purpose and he ransomed you by pulling you back from the rancid jaws of death just so that the world knows! Be safe ;). Know Jesus. Know peace.
